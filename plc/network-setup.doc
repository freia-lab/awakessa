How to change the network set-up of the PLC and the HMI panel

1. Start with changing of the network settings of the PLC

Open "System" screen on the amplifier's touch panel

Change the Network Settings (IP Addr, Mask, Gateway)

Press "Load the new network settings" Button
      The PLC should have the new IP address - the connection between the HMI panel and the PLC will be lost, the Modbus connection to the new address should work.

Now one needs to change the communication parameters of the touch panel.

On the "System" screen press "Stop HMI RunTime" button (see "HMI devices Basic Panels 2nd Generation" https://cache.industry.siemens.com/dl/files/350/90114350/att_904652/v1/HWBasicPanels2GenUS_en-US.pdf )

Navigate to "Settings -> "Service and Commisioning" and scroll down the left panel to "Edit Connections"
Proceed from Step 1 to 2 without any change
In step 2 change the IP address to the address of the PLC. Don't change the name of the connection (HMI_Connection_1)
Scroll down and make sure the switch button is in ON position (connection uses entered IP address)
Proceed to Step 3 and press "Accept" button

Go back to the top menu and press "Start" button


After changing the PLC's IP address one needs to power cycle the PLC in order to restart the OPC UA server (if needed)
